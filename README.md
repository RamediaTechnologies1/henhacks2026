## The Problem

UDel students report maintenance issues by emailing **fixit@udel.edu**. A human dispatcher manually reads each email, classifies the trade type, assesses priority, creates a work order in IBM Maximo, and routes it to the correct team. This process is slow, error-prone, and creates a dangerous bottleneck — especially for safety-critical issues like exposed wiring, flooded stairwells, or broken fire exits where every minute matters.

Meanwhile, students walking through campus have **zero visibility** into known hazards. A broken handrail on the 3rd floor of Gore Hall could injure someone before the email even gets triaged.

## Our Solution

**FixIt AI turns every student into a safety sensor and uses AI to transform reactive maintenance into proactive safety prevention.**

A student snaps a photo of an issue. Within seconds, our AI analyzes it — classifying the trade type, assessing safety risks (slip/fall, fire hazard, electrical shock, structural failure, and more), scoring severity on a 0-10 scale, and predicting what happens if it goes unfixed. The report is auto-dispatched to the correct department. Critical safety hazards are auto-escalated to the campus safety director. And every other student on campus can now see the hazard before they walk into it.

No emails. No dispatcher. No delays. **Photo in, safety out.**

## Three-Portal Architecture

### Portal 1: Student (Report & Stay Safe)

Students capture maintenance issues and get real-time safety awareness.

| **Interactive Floor Plans** | Tap the exact room on SVG floor plans (Gore Hall, Smith Hall) |
| **Voice Input** | Dictate descriptions via Web Speech API — hands-free accessibility |
| **Anonymous Reporting** | Toggle anonymous mode — identity stripped before storage, encouraging safety reports |
| **Safety Alerts** | See active campus hazards when opening the app — make safer choices |
| **Emergency Button** | One-tap critical safety report — dispatches safety team immediately |
| **QR Code Scan** | Scan room QR codes to pre-fill location — zero friction reporting |

## How It Answers the Categories

### Automation Systems & Public Infrastructure

> *"How might we use technology to make public systems more reliable, accessible, and adaptive to real human needs?"*

- **Eliminates the human dispatcher** — AI classifies and routes in seconds, not hours
- **Auto-assignment algorithm** scores technicians on 4 factors and dispatches optimally
- **Smart deduplication** — multiple reports of the same issue become a single work order with upvotes
- **Pattern detection** — 3+ reports of the same trade in 90 days triggers preventive maintenance alerts
- **QR codes on rooms** — infrastructure becomes self-reporting

### Security & Safety

> *"How might we create systems that keep information secure, safeguard communities, or help individuals make safer choices?"*

**Keep information secure:**
- Anonymous reporting with identity stripping — no name/email stored for anonymous reports
- PIN-based auth with 10-minute expiry, sessions expire in 24 hours
- Data transparency — students see exactly what's collected and how it's used
- Reporter identity hidden from technicians on anonymous reports

**Safeguard communities:**
- AI Safety Risk Taxonomy — every report is assessed for 8 risk categories (slip/fall, fire, electrical shock, structural failure, water damage, air quality, security vulnerability, chemical exposure)
- Building Safety Index — real-time per-building safety scores (0-10)
- Predictive Safety Alerts — report clusters trigger systemic risk warnings
- Auto-escalation — critical safety hazards auto-email the campus safety director
- One-tap emergency reporting — 2 taps to dispatch the safety team

**Help individuals make safer choices:**
- Campus Safety Alerts — students see active hazards when they open the app
- Risk Escalation Warnings — AI tells you what happens if the issue goes unfixed
- Safety heatmap on campus map — buildings color-coded by danger level
- Frictionless reporting (photo + voice + QR) lowers barriers to protecting the community

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript |

| **AI Vision** | Multi-provider fallback: OpenAI GPT-4o → Claude → Gemini → Groq |
| **Email** | Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP (dispatch + escalation) |
| **Maps** | React-Leaflet with CARTO dark tiles |
| **Floor Plans** | Custom SVG — zero dependencies, touch-friendly |
| **Voice** | Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) |

## AI Pipeline

```
Photo → [OpenAI GPT-4o / Claude / Gemini / Groq]
                    ↓
        ┌──────────────────────────┐
        │  Trade Classification     │  plumbing, electrical, hvac, structural...
        │  Priority Assessment      │  critical, high, medium, low
        │  Safety Risk Taxonomy     │  8 risk categories scored 0-10
        │  Risk Escalation          │  "If unfixed: ceiling could collapse..."
        │  Recommended Action       │  "Replace corroded pipe section..."
        │  Confidence Score         │  0.0 - 1.0
        └──────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
        Auto-dispatch email → Department
        Auto-assign → Best technician
        Auto-escalate → Safety director (if critical)
```

The system tries up to 4 AI providers in sequence. If OpenAI quota is exhausted, it falls back to Claude, then Gemini, then Groq — ensuring the system never goes down.

## Smart Features

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Deduplication** | Same building + same trade within 7 days → upvote original instead of duplicate |
| **Urgency Score** | `base_priority + (upvotes × 1.5) + (safety ? 3 : 0)` — safety issues bubble to top |
| **Pattern Detection** | 3+ reports of same trade in 90 days → preventive maintenance alert |
| **Building Safety Index** | `safety_issues × 3 + critical × 2.5 + high × 1.5 + open × 0.3` → 0-10 score |
| **SLA Tracking** | Color-coded elapsed time — green (ok), yellow (4h+), orange (warning), red (SLA breach) |
| **Predictive Alerts** | Clusters of same-trade reports → "Possible pipe deterioration. Risk: water damage, mold" |
